# Bash-Project

For my Bash project I created a File permissions manager, which helps users manage file permissions, allowing them to change ownership and file permissions

The repo includes 3 files 
1. bash-project-script (bash script file)
2. file.txt (test file)
3. README file

The bash-project-script
Check for files and the has the ability to change ownership of the file using chown
The script also can change permission using chmod scripts
